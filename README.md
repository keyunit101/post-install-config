# Post-Install Config
<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
<p>Now that osTicket is installed, I need to perform some administrative tasks. The first step is to configure roles. Roles in osTicket define a user's level of access and permissions within the system. Therefore, I will create a role named "Head Admin" by navigating to Admin Panel -> Agents -> Roles -> Add Role.</p>

<p>Next, I will assign permissions to the "Head Admin" role. Permissions determine the level of access and actions that a user or group of users can perform within the system.</p>

<p>Now, I will create departments in the osTicket system by accessing the "Departments" section in the Admin Panel through Agents -> Departments. I will create a department named "System Administrator". A department is a group or team responsible for handling specific types of tickets, ensuring that tickets are directed to the appropriate team or individual.</p>

<p>Now, I will configure a team named 'Level II Support' by going to the Admin Panel -> Agents -> Teams. Teams are designed to help organize and expedite support requests, particularly in situations where there is a high volume of incoming tickets.</p>

<p>Next, I will configure an agent named 'Lebron James'. Agents are typically Helpdesk professionals who configure tickets.</p>

<p>Now, I will create new users in the osTicket system by accessing the "Users" section in the Agent Panel and clicking on "Add New." In an osTicket system, a user is someone who interacts with the system by submitting tickets, providing additional information or feedback, or accessing support resources. These users can be customers, employees, or any other individuals who require support or assistance from the organization using osTicket. In this case, my user will be "Micheal Jordan".</p>
